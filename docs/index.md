# Monitoring tools

## üìñ Overview
Monitoring tools enable continuous application performance monitoring (APM) and health monitoring for product teams; 
these tools are primarily managed by the Enterprise Command Center (ECC) Monitoring Architecture and Standards (MAS) team; 
current ECC provides the following core toolsets:

* DSO AI Operations (AIOps) Platform ‚Äì ScienceLogic (SL1)
* AppDynamics*
* Aternity
* Dynatrace*
* Splunk*
* SolarWinds

*\*Indicates solution is more commonly used*

## üö™ Onboarding process 
Submit a reqest to add monitoring services through SNOW; upon submission, the Change Request Management (CRM) team 
works coordinates between the Demand Review Board (DRB), and CRM Intake to accept or reject the request; upon acceptance, 
CRM acts as a program manager for the ECC MAS team, which provisions and sets up the tool per the initial request[^1]
